            <li>You will be directed to a third-party platform, Strider, which partners with Pulley to facilitate the token purchase.</li>
			<li>This approach provides more flexible ways to share content while prioritizing privacy.</li>
			<li>After purchasing the token through Strider, they will send an invite link that redirects back to the Channel.</li>
			<li>Along with your receipt from Strider, the token you receive will serve as proof of membership for rp.siteâ€”similar to buying a ticket to a show, with Strider acting as the ticket distributor.</li>
            
			If you encounter any issues, please contact us directly, rather than Strider.<br><br>
